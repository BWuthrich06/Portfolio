        <p id="about_me_intro">Hi, I'm Briana!</p>

        <p class="about_me_text"> I'm a passionate entry-level software engineer currently living in Arizona. Before venturing into the
            tech world, I spent 13 years in nursing, embracing the chaos and bringing a compassionate
            touch to healthcare.</p>
        
        <p class="about_me_text">Eager to learn and grow, I'm diving headfirst into coding adventures. My background in nursing
            taught me resilience and adaptability, qualities I'm now channeling into crafting innovative
            solutions in the tech realm. However, my insatiable curiosity
            and love for problem-solving led me to embark on a thrilling new adventure â€“ transitioning
            from a registered nurse to a software engineer.</p>
            
        <p class="about_me_text">I recently completed the intensive 12-week Full Stack Software Engineering program at
            Hackbright Academy, where I immersed myself in the world of technology. Armed with newfound
            skills in Python, Flask, SQL, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and more, I'm excited to bring a fresh
            perspective and be apart of this coding adventure.</p>
            
        <p class="about_me_text">The journey from nursing to software engineering has not only sharpened my technical abilities
            but has also honed my resilience, adaptability, and dedication. I approach each coding challenge
            with the same passion and commitment that defined my years in healthcare.</p>
            
        <p class="about_me_text">As I step into this vibrant community of problem-solvers and innovators, I am eager to contribute
            my skills and continue learning and growing on this exciting path.</p>
